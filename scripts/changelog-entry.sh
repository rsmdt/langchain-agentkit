# Generate a CHANGELOG.md entry for the current HEAD and print it to stdout.
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/changelog-entry.sh <new-version> [previous-tag]
#
# Reads commits in [previous-tag..HEAD] and pipes them to `claude -p` with
# instructions to synthesize a Keep a Changelog entry — highlighting breaking
# changes, grouping related commits, and skipping trivial noise. The previous
# tag is auto-detected via `git describe` if not supplied.
#
# The output is written to stdout. Review it, edit if needed, then paste it
# into CHANGELOG.md after the intro paragraph (before the most recent entry).
#
# Example:
#     scripts/changelog-entry.sh 0.16.0 > /tmp/entry.md
#     # review /tmp/entry.md, edit if needed, prepend manually to CHANGELOG.md

You are writing a CHANGELOG.md entry for version ${NEW_VERSION} of the
langchain-agentkit project, dated ${DATE}.

Below is the git commit history since the previous release (${PREV_TAG}).
Commits are separated by '---%---'. Conventional commit prefixes indicate
the type: feat, fix, refactor, chore, docs, test, style, ci, perf.

Write a CHANGELOG entry in Keep a Changelog format. Follow these rules:

1. Header: '## [${NEW_VERSION}] — ${DATE}'
2. Group into these sections (omit empty ones): Added, Changed, Fixed,
   Removed, Deprecated, Security.
3. **Summarize, don't enumerate.** Merge related commits into single
   coherent bullets. Target 2-6 bullets per section. The git log already
   has the per-commit detail — this is the human-readable summary.
4. **Highlight breaking changes** with a '**BREAKING**:' prefix on the
   bullet. Detect them from (a) '!' after the commit type, (b)
   'BREAKING CHANGE:' footers in the body, (c) contextual cues such as
   renames, removals, or signature changes to public APIs.
5. **Skip trivial commits**: style, chore (except version bumps — still
   skip those), test, ci, and routine docs changes. Include them only
   if they represent user-visible changes (e.g. a README rewrite that
   documents a new workflow, or a new test category users should know
   about).
6. **Write for users, not contributors.** Describe what changed from
   the user's perspective ('Added HistoryExtension for context window
   management'), not how the code was restructured ('Created new file
   extensions/history/extension.py'). Prefer prose that explains the
   outcome over technical implementation detail.
7. Output the markdown entry only. No preamble, no code fences, no
   explanation before or after. Start with the '## [${NEW_VERSION}]'
   header and end with the last bullet of the last section.
